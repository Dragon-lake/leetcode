# Intersection of Two Linked Lists

## Problem：

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, the following two linked lists:
 </p>
 <pre>
A:          a1 → a2
                   ↘
                     c1 → c2 → c3
                   ↗            
B:     b1 → b2 → b3
</pre>
 <p>
  begin to intersect at node c1.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Notes:
  </b>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return
   <code>
    null
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
  </li>
  <li>
   You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.
  </li>
 </ul>
