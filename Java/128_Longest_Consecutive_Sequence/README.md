# Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example,
  <br/>
  Given
  <code>
   [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
  </code>
  ,
  <br/>
  The longest consecutive elements sequence is
  <code>
   [1, 2, 3, 4]
  </code>
  . Return its length:
  <code>
   4
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Your algorithm should run in O(
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  ) complexity.
