## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Follow up for "Unique Paths":
 </p>
 <p>
  Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
 </p>
 <p>
  An obstacle and empty space is marked as
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  respectively in the grid.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example,
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
 </p>
 <pre>
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
</pre>
 <p>
  The total number of unique paths is
  <code>
   2
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
