# First Bad Version

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suppose you have
  <code>
   n
  </code>
  versions
  <code>
   [1, 2, ..., n]
  </code>
  and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
 </p>
 <p>
  You are given an API
  <code>
   bool isBadVersion(version)
  </code>
  which will return whether
  <code>
   version
  </code>
  is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
