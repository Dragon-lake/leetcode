# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Problem：

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor" target="_blank">
   definition of LCA on Wikipedia
  </a>
  : “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow
  <b>
   a node to be a descendant of itself
  </b>
  ).”

         /  \
         7   4
</pre>
 <p>
  For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes
  <code>
   5
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  is
  <code>
   3
  </code>
  . Another example is LCA of nodes
  <code>
   5
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   4
  </code>
  is
  <code>
   5
  </code>
  , since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
