   Some hints:
  </b>
  <p>
   Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
  </p>
  <p>
   If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
  </p>
  <p>
   You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
