# Gas Station

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are
  <i>
   N
  </i>
  gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station
  <i>
   i
  </i>
  is
  <code>
   gas[i]
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs
  <code>
   cost[i]
  </code>
  of gas to travel from station
  <i>
   i
  </i>
  to its next station (
  <i>
   i
  </i>
  +1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 </p>
 <p>
  Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
  </b>
  <br/>
  The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
