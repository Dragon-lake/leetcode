# Kth Smallest Element in a BST

## Problem：

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given a binary search tree, write a function
  <code>
   kthSmallest
  </code>
  to find the
  <b>
   k
  </b>
  th smallest element in it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
  </b>
  <br/>
  You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Follow up:
  </b>
  <br/>
  What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?
