# Find Peak Element

## Problem：

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given an input array where
  <code>
   num[i] ≠ num[i+1]
  </code>
  , find a peak element and return its index.
 </p>
 <p>
  The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  You may imagine that
  <code>
   num[-1] = num[n] = -∞
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, in array
  <code>
   [1, 2, 3, 1]
  </code>
  , 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
