# Sort Colors

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given an array with
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
  </b>
  <br/>
  You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

   <br/>
   A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
   <br/>
   First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
  </p>
  <p>
   Could you come up with an one-pass algorithm using only constant space?
