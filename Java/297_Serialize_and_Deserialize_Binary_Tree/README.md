# Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

 <p>
  Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, you may serialize the following tree
 </p>
 <pre>
    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5
</pre>
 as
 <code>
  "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
 </code>
 , just the same as

  how LeetCode OJ serializes a binary tree
 </a>
 . You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
  </b>
  Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.
