## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 </p>
 <p>
  Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example,
 </p>
 <pre>
Given s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT",

Return:
["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"].
</pre>
