## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given a binary tree, find the maximum path sum.
 </p>
 <p>
  For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path does not need to go through the root.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
  <br/>
  Given the below binary tree,
 </p>
 <pre>
       1
      / \
     2   3
</pre>
 <p>
  Return
  <code>
   6
  </code>
  .
