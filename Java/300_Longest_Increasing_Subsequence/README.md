# Longest Increasing Subsequence

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example,
  <br/>
  Given
  <code>
   [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]
  </code>
  ,
  <br/>
  The longest increasing subsequence is
  <code>
   [2, 3, 7, 101]
  </code>
  , therefore the length is
  <code>
   4
  </code>
  . Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your algorithm should run in O(
  <i>
   n
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
  </i>
  ) complexity.
 </p>
 <p>

  </b>
  Could you improve it to O(
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  log
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  ) time complexity?
