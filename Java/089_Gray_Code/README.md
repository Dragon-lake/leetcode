# Gray Code

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  Given a non-negative integer
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, given
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  = 2, return
  <code>
   [0,1,3,2]
  </code>
  . Its gray code sequence is:
 </p>
 <pre>
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2
</pre>
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
  </b>
  <br/>
  For a given
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  , a gray code sequence is not uniquely defined.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example,
  <code>
   [0,2,3,1]
  </code>
  is also a valid gray code sequence according to the above definition.
 </p>
 <p>
  For now, the judge is able to judge based on one instance of gray code sequence. Sorry about that.
