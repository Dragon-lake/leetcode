# Implement Queue using Stacks

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
  </li>
  <li>
   pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
  </li>
  <li>
   peek() -- Get the front element.
  </li>
  <li>
   empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <b>
  Notes:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   You must use
   <i>
    only
   </i>
   standard operations of a stack -- which means only
   <code>
    push to top
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    peek/pop from top
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    size
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    is empty
   </code>
   operations are valid.
  </li>
  <li>
   Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.
  </li>
  <li>
   You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).
  </li>
 </ul>
</div>
