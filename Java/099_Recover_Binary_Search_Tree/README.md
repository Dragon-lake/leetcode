## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Recover the tree without changing its structure.

 <br/>
 A solution using O(
 <i>
  n

 ) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?

   OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
  </b>
  <p>
   The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
  </p>
  <p>
   Here's an example:
   <br/>
  </p>
  <pre>
   1
  / \
 2   3
    /
   4
    \
     5
</pre>
  The above binary tree is serialized as
  <code>
   "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}"
  </code>
  .
