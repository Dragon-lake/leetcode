# Find the Duplicate Number

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>

 <p>
  Given an array
  <i>
   nums
  </i>
  containing
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

  <br/>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   You
   <b>
    must not
   </b>
   modify the array (assume the array is read only).
  </li>
  <li>
   You must use only constant,
   <i>
    O
   </i>
   (1) extra space.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your runtime complexity should be less than
   <code>
    O(n
    <sup>
     2
    </sup>
    )
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.
  </li>
 </ol>
