# String to Integer (atoi)

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Implement
  <span style="font-family:monospace">
   atoi
  </span>
  to convert a string to an integer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Hint:
  </b>
  Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Notes:
  </b>
  It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

  The signature of the
  <code>
   C++
  </code>
  function had been updated. If you still see your function signature accepts a
  <code>
   const char *

   Requirements for atoi:
  </b>
  <p>
   The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.
  </p>
  <p>
   The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.
  </p>
  <p>
   If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.
  </p>
  <p>
   If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2147483647) or INT_MIN (-2147483648) is returned.
