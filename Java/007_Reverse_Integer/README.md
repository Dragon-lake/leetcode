# Reverse Integer

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Reverse digits of an integer.
 </p>
 <p style="font-family:monospace">
  <b>
   Example1:
  </b>
  x =  123, return  321
  <br/>
  <b>
   Example2:
  </b>
  x = -123, return -321

   Have you thought about this?
  </b>
  <p>
   Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
  </p>
  <p>
   If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
  </p>
  <p>
   Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
  </p>
  <p>
   For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

   Test cases had been added to test the overflow behavior.
