# Course Schedule

## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  There are a total of
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  courses you have to take, labeled from
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  to
  <code>
   n - 1
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair:
  <code>
   [0,1]
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite
  <b>
   pairs
  </b>
  , is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <pre>2, [[1,0]]</pre>
 <p>
  There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 </p>
 <pre>2, [[1,0],[0,1]]</pre>
 <p>
  There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

  The input prerequisites is a graph represented by

   a list of edges

   Hints:
  </b>
  <ol>
   <li>
    This problem is equivalent to finding if a cycle exists in a directed graph. If a cycle exists, no topological ordering exists and therefore it will be impossible to take all courses.
