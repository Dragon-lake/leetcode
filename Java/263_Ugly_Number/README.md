 <p>
  Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
 </p>
 <p>
  Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include
  <code>
   2, 3, 5
  </code>
  . For example,
  <code>
   6, 8
  </code>
  are ugly while
  <code>
   14
  </code>
  is not ugly since it includes another prime factor
  <code>
   7
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Note that
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  is typically treated as an ugly number.
