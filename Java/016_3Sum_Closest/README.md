## Problemï¼š

<div class="question-content">
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  Given an array
  <i>
   S
  </i>
  of
  <i>
   n
  </i>
  integers, find three integers in
  <i>
   S
  </i>
  such that the sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 </p>
 <pre>
    For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.

    The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
